"The cycle time for the 'PLC' runtime generated by LDmicro is user-configurable. Very short cycle times may not be achievable due to processor speed constraints, and very long cycle times may not be achievable due to hardware overflows. Cycle times between 10 ms and 100 ms will usually be practical.\r\n\r\nThe compiler must know what speed crystal you are using with the micro to convert between timing in clock cycles and timing in seconds. A 4 MHz to 20 MHz crystal is typical; check the speed grade of the part you are using to determine the maximum allowable clock speed before choosing a crystal."
"由LDmicro生成的'PLC'平台运行时循环时间可由用户配置。，太短的循环时间可能由于处理器速度限制无法达到，太长的循环时间可能由于硬件溢出无法达到。10ms到100ms之间的循环时间通常是可行的。\r\n\r\n"
