Ladder Logic for Netzer, PIC and AVR

The original code (Release 2.2) was taken form the Ladder Micro project maintained by Jonathan Westhues: http://cq.cx/ladder.pl

Basically the project is extended with CMake list files to build it with other toolchains like MinGW compiler (also CrossCompile is possible from Linux).

Furthermore some special features for the Netzer (PIC based) platform are added. On this platform a very fast  interpreter (entirely written in assembler) was implemented, which runs with int code generated by this ldmico extension. Read more: http://www.mobacon.de/wiki/doku.php/en/netzer/process
