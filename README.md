ldmicro
=======

Ladder Logic for Netzer, PIC and AVR

The original code (Release 2.2) was taken form the Ladder Micro project maintained by Jonathan Westhues: http://cq.cx/ladder.pl

Basically the project is extended with CMake list files to build it with other toolchains like MinGW compiler (also CrossCompile is possible from Linux).

Furthermore some special features for the Netzer (PIC based) platform are added. On this platform a very fast  interpreter (entirely written in assembler) was implemented, which runs with int code generated by this ldmico extension. Read more: http://www.mobacon.de/wiki/doku.php/en/netzer/process


Compiling on Windows
--------------------

For compiling on Windows start a command prompt and enter the following commands:

```
    cd ldmicro
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DLANGUAGE=DE ..
    make all
```

Ensure that CMake, MinGW and MSYS are installed and in your path.
LANGUAGE can be set to EN, DE, FR, ES, IT, PT or TR.


Compiling on Linux
------------------

For cross compiling on Linux start a command prompt and enter the following commands:

```
    cd ldmicro
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../Toolchain-mingw32.cmake -DLANGUAGE=DE ..
    make all
```

LANGUAGE can be set to EN, DE, FR, ES, IT, PT or TR.

MinGW and CMake can be installed with 

    sudo apt-get install mingw32 cmake
    
 
Using on Linux
--------------

For using ldmicro on Linux you have to install wine and winetricks.
After installation you also should install ldmicro used fonts:

    winetricks Lucida Tahoma

Start ldmicro with simply typing:

    ./ldmicro.exe
